## Introduction


### Abstract

Social network sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, enable people to connect with each other, and share messages and media. We believe social network sites have significant benefits for people and society. 

However, we also believe that the big social networks have problems. There are user data breaches, hacker fake accounts, corporate lack of accountability, over-emphasis on advertising, and walled-off restrictions. These problems harm people and society. 

We therefore propose new social network ideas, such as a social network that is a not-for-profit (NFP), that uses free/open/libre source (FLOSS), that has accountability and transparancy, and that is for social good.


### Feedback

We welcome feedback, suggestions, and constructive criticism. You can contact us by email (joel@joelparkerhenderson.com), Twitter ([@joel_henderson](https://twitter.com/joel_henderson)), or by using GitHub issues or pull requests.


### About this document

We are using this document a work in progress. We are improving this document as we learn. 

We intend this document to be a friendly introduction to the areas that we want to discuss; we do not intend for this document to be a comprehensive reference, or a literature review, or a societal manifesto, or a technological specification. We do welcome links to all these areas.

We want to use this document to explore the viability of new social network that helps people. Specifically, we want this document to look at both the purpose i.e. why do this, and also the pragmatics i.e. how to create this.

We use quotations with light editing for content, context, readability, consistency, and anonymity.


## Baseline


### Social context

We are looking at the biggest social networks such as 
[Facebook](https://facebook.com) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com).

We like websites using technology for social common good such as 
[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and
[Craigslist](https://craigslist.org).

We look to technology advocacy groups such as 
[Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](http://eff.org/) and
[Open Source Initiative (OSI)](http://https://opensource.org/).


### Technical context

We are frequent users of social coding sites such as 
[GitHub](https://github.com) and
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

We are users of social identity tools such as 
[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) and
[Keybase](keybase.io).

We like decentralized distributed social networks such as
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) and
[Patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork).


### Social internet vs. social media

We see a useful distinction between social internet and social media:

 * "Social internet describes the general ways in which the global communication network and open protocols known as “the internet” enable good things like connecting people, spreading information, and supporting expression and activism."

* "Social media, by contrast, describes the attempt to privatize these capabilities by large companies within the newly emerged algorithmic attention economy, a particularly virulent strain of the attention sector that leverages personal data and sophisticated algorithms to ruthlessly siphon users’ cognitive capital."


## Challenges


### Open issues

Open issues that are especially important to discuss:

* [**Funding**: advertisements, donations, subscriptions?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/1)
* [**Audience**: general public, niche groups, special needs?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/2)
* [**Scope**: benefits, features, minimum viable product?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/3)
* [**Comparisons**: similarities/differences versus others?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/4)
* [**Names**: real names, fake names, no names?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/5)
* [**Data**: who owns it, who uses it, who controls it?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/6)
* [**Security**: spammers, hackers, masqueraders?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/7)
* [**Community**: how can we encourage people to help?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/8)
* [**Motivation**: gamification, extrinsic, intrinsic?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/9)
* [**Niches**: music, meets, malls, mashups, more?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/10)
* [**Feeds**: linear, algorithmic, customizable?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/11)
* [**Topology**: centralized, decentralized, distributed, federated?](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/12)
* (more?)

### Original content vs. resharing

* "Reshares are part and parcel of a community - even before the days of the Internet. For many, gossip is part of socializing. A friend posted that he's just getting married. People will want to spread the word. How can they without reshares? Rewrite it themselves? Resharing is simply part of usual human interaction."
-->


### How to describe a social network?

We see challenges in how people describe social networks; we suggest starter questions.

Examples:

* **Benefits**: give me reasons to try your product.
* **Privacy**: what is your privacy policy, including sharing with 3rd party?
* **Platform**: is your product aiming to be a platform, API, plugin, integation, etc.?
* **Access**: mobile, web, desktop, native, etc.?
* **Code**: open source, closed source, etc.?
* (more?)


### Articles

We are reading articles and posts by social network advocates such as:
* [Social media and its discontents by Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/03/20/on-social-media-and-its-discontents/)
* [Paradigm shifts for the decentralized web](https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2017/12/20/paradigm-shifts-for-the-decentralized-web/)
* [The Search for the Anti-Facebook](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/10/ello_diaspora_and_the_anti_facebook_why_alternative_social_networks_can.html)
* [Let's verify real people, not real names](https://bford.github.io/2015/10/07/names.html)
* [Y Combinator’s nonprofit funding](https://blog.ycombinator.com/what-y-combinator-looks-for-in-nonprofits/)
* [Human Connection](https://human-connection.org)
* (more?)


## Minimum Viable Product

We believe that to be successful, the best path is to create the simplest-possible social network that people will actually use. This is a minimum viable product (MVP).


### Yes, likely in scope

Capabilities that we believe must be in scope:
* Join: e.g. sign up, sign in, sign out, manage your data, delete your account
* Post: e.g. with a combination of title, text, link, image
* Wall: e.g. a profile page, news feed, timeline, calendar
* Item: e.g. a person, place, event, organization


### Maybe, possibly in scope

Capabilities that we like, yet don't know if they must be in scope:
* Vote: e.g. like, love, star, upvote, downvote, flag
* Blob: e.g. photo, video, audio, document
* Team: e.g. group, circle, room, forum, channel


### No, not in scope

Capabilities that we want to defer to future scope:
* Chat
* Notifications
* Mobile apps
* Old browsers
* Live streams
* Payments


## User Experience


### Sign in

Discuss sign in options via:
* Email address and password
* Multi-factor e.g. mobile phone SMS, Google Authenticator app
* Providers e.g. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn
* Protocols e.g. OAuth, SAML
* Integrators e.g. Okta.com


### Stories

Discuss stories:
* Can we use RSS?
* Can we use Atom?
* Why/how to provide what companies say they want, e.g. ads, analytics, branding?


### Routes

Discuss idea of meta-routes using:
* Email address: https://www.example.com/alice@example.com
* Phone number: https://www.example.com/18005551111
* Domain name: https://www.example.com/reddit.com
* Overlay name: https://www.example.com/reddit.com/u/alice
* Key encoding: https://www.example.com/isbn/123456789
* Geo location: https://www.example.com/map/lat/lng/alt
* Unique id: https://www.example.com/0x1234567890

Brainstorms:
* Could meta-routes make it easier to sign up?
* Could meta-routes make it much easier to automate account creation?

Overlay site ideas:
* Social: Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+
* Music: Soundcloud, Spotify
* Photos: Imgur, Flickr
* Videos: YouTube, Vimeo
* News: Reddit, Digg


## Implementation


### Planning

Discuss broad goals:
* This project is more akin to an ambitious web app, less akin to a blogging site.
* We value participation by many people and organizations.
* The security needs to be bulletproof and independently-verifiable.

Discuss organizational areas:
* Prefer truly free technology over corporate-restricted technology.
* Prefer more-welcoming communities over less-welcoming communities.
* Prefer agile over waterfall.

Discuss project management such as:
* Planning e.g. Asana, Trello
* Dicussion e.g. IRC, Slack
* Prototyping e.g. Balsamiq, Photoshop

Discuss planning methodologies:
* Agile, lean, kanban, waterfall, etc.
* Model, view, controller (MVC), data, context, interaction (DCI), etc. 
* Functional code may be easier to create reliably and easier to scale up.


### Full stack

* Popular tech e.g. React, Node, C++
* Powerful tech e.g. Java, Kotlin, Clojure
* Progressive tech e.g. Ember, Elixir, Rust
* Mobile tech e.g. iOS, Android, React Native

Discuss databases such as:
* Relation-oriented e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
* Document-oriented e.g. Mongo
* Speed-oriented e.g. Redis, Memcached
* Graph-oriented e.g. Fauna, Neo4J
* Vendor-oriented e.g. Google Spanner, Amazon Aurora

Discuss data exchange such as:
